<h1>The Legal Struggle Over Reconstruction</h1>
<p>The Reconstruction era was a period in time that followed the Civil War. During this era, the United States wanted to set right the lack of unfairness of slavery, and its political, social, and economic legacy it held. Through the new laws and constitutional amendments, American citizenship was changed forever. While the Civil War addressed the problem of abolition and slavery through bloodshed, these same tensions followed through in the legislative quarrel over reconstruction and Northern and Southern treatment of free blacks, which incited a divide between Federal and State law in the form of the 13th, 14th, 15th amendments, the Civil rights acts of the 1860s, enforcement acts and opposing black codes and the convict lease system.

<h3>The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments</h3>
<p>The Reconstruction era was a period in time that followed the Civil War. During this era, the United States wanted to set right the lack of unfairness of slavery, and its political, social, and economic legacy it held. Through the new laws, and constitutional amendments, American citizenship was changed forever. A main factor in defining American citizenship was due to the creation of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. These three amendments played a significant role during the reconstruction era. The 13th amendment was the first constitutional amendment to be signed during the reconstruction era. It was ratified on January 31st, 1865. This amendment stated that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction”. This amendment, ultimately made slavery illegal unless convicted of a crime. Even though, “congress tried to define citizenship and the rights of newly freed slaves” many Southern states did not agree with this amendment, and still continued to have slaves, and deny slaves of their freedom. So, in 1668 the second amendment during the reconstruction era was passed which was known as the 14th amendment. Congress, constructed this amendment soon after the 13th because, they wanted to make clear that anyone born in the United States was granted citizenship. In the 14th amendment, there were many different sections inside of the main amendment. The different sections consisted of defining one's citizenship, blacks were given the right to vote (revised the ⅗ compromise), the president could not pardon rebels, they voided all debts acquired to support rebellion, and congress were allowed to pass further legislation. All these parts to the amendment, added to the legacy of the reconstruction era. And lastly, in 1868 after Grant had won the election, the 15th amendment was created. This was the final amendment created during the reconstruction era. This amendment “prohibited federal & state governments from denying any citizen the right to vote because of race” (Foner, 460). This amendment allowed suffrage and made it illegal for the government to restrict voting rights because of someone's race. But, even though the amendment had been created for over a century, African Americans did not have true voting rights until the 20th century. Overall, the creation of these three amendments, played an important role in American history because it defined many Americans citizenship, and allowed them rights that many were not guaranteed before. But, even though these three amendments imprinted a legacy, that would never be forgotten, there were many other factors that contributed to what made up the Reconstruction Era.

			<h4>The Journal of Civilization (1867)</h4>
			<p>This image displays African American men waiting in line to cast a vote. This image is very monumental because, this is the first time that African American’s, were given a full vote (not just ⅗ of one). This image took place in 1867, so a few years after the 13th amendment was ratified. They are all finally able to contribute and play a role in the political aspects of the United States. Also, these men are all dressed up quite nicely, wearing work attire. This gives off the perception that African American’s, were finally capable of getting a real job, and not being forced into unfair slave labour. This image, is titled as “A Journal of Civilization”. Just by observing this image, it is clear how post Civil War, African Americans were given some citizenship, and were taking steps to more equal rights. Overall, this image is very important, because it portrays a good understanding of the laws and the citizen rights that were given to African American’s during the Reconstruction Era.

		<h4>The Disablement of Law Enforcement (1868)</h4>
		<p>This image, is portraying a fat man lying on a hammock that is titled “Law Enforcement”. On the ground next to the congressmen’s feet, is a broken firearm that is labeled “14th amendment, second section”. These two illustrations, are very significant because the congressmen lying on the hammock is representing how law enforcement is being “slept” on, and disabled. The broken firearm also represents the disablement of law enforcement, and how nothing can be enforced if the mechanism to enforce laws are broken. Also, another significant aspect to the image, is the young African American boy, who is holding a drum. This gives us the impression that he was wanting to wake the congressmen up using the drum, but in the background of this image, there is an elephant that states “Don’t wake him up”. The boy with the drum represents African Americans speaking up and wanting to be seen and heard by congress, but being shut down and told to be quiet. Even though, the second section in the 14th amendment revised the ⅗ compromise, and allowed blacks the right to vote, this law was being slept on, and not taken very seriously.

<h3>Civil Rights bill of 1866</h3>
<p>“Citizenship” has been an ever changing definition of how to classify one’s rights in America. Being defined as a citizen allows someone access to a lot more rights and equality than someone who does not fall under that category, being a citizen allows for someone to be protected under the federal law whereas not being defined as one would leave them vulnerable and their rights at question. Before the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, the term “citizen” was a very constricted term, restricted to applying solely to white males. In 1866 the first Federal Law to define citizenship was passed. The Law is referred to as the “Civil Rights Bill of 1866” and was originally written by United States Senator Lyman Trumbull. The Law defined all persons born in the United States as citizens, without regard to their ethnicity or race. The Law also states that any person labeled a citizen, regardless of race or previous enslavement status has the right to sue and be sued, give evidence in court, and inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. However, for this law to apply, one must not be subject to any other foreign powers. Following this Law, another very similar one was written into the proposed fourteenth amendment called the “Citizenship Clause.” The Bill of 1866 was passed in congress in 1865, to come into play in the midst of the civil war. However, the law was then vetoed by President Andrew Johnson and was not able to become Federal Law until later in April 1866, when Congress again passed the bill to support the Thirteenth Amendment. Johnson once again vetoed it, but a two-thirds majority in each of the chambers overrode the veto and allowed it to become a law without the president's signature. The law also stated that if anyone who tried to deny citizen these rights due to race or previous enslavement status was able to be fined an amount not exceeding $1,000 dollars, be imprisoned for no time exceeding a year, or both. The ways in which these “punishments” are written plays a large role in why this Bill failed in its attempts to equalize society. This is because while the law states one will be punished if breaking the rules aligned with this bill, it says you will be fined no more than 1,000 dollars and will not be in jail longer than 1 year. It can be assumed that this allowed for many persons who broke this law to go unjustly punished or even unpunished. Ultimately, this law did not have great impacts on societal equality and the Safety of African Americans but was the first time the term “citizenship” was defined by Federal Law, attempting to give Black people some protection under Federal Rights.  </p>

<p>The Image (right) I have chosen to display is titled“The Constitutional Amendment!” This Image is an original 1866 cartoon poster used for Hiester Clymer as he was running against Republican gubernatorial nominee John White Geary. The image shows a group of black boys, all identical looking, aggressively shoving a group of white men through a doorway labeled “polls.” Around the Image, there are vertical texts naming different presidential candidates and stating what they believe they are “for.” on the other side in vertical text it says, “who voted for this bill” followed by another list of names. Clymer was a big supporter of white supremacy and this image was created to attack competitors for the presidential candidacy. The posters served as a way to attack post-war republic efforts to enfranchise blacks. This image is showing a very extreme version of what Clymer lead to believe the world would look like after allowing black people the right to vote. One of the men being pushed through the doorway says, “Negroes rule us now”  indicating that white supremacists had an idea that giving black people any rights that would in any way equalize their rights in the slightest that they would lose all their power to them and become basically what the black people were to them at that moment.

<h3>Black Codes and the Convict Lease System</h3>
<p>In response to the many legal maneuvers that the republican abolitionists both in Northern states and in federal law, southern democrats attempted to retaliate with their own legal institutions called Black Code laws. These Black code laws were state laws that attempted to continue black oppression and later on continue free labor in the form of the convict lease system. These laws were originated from the legal system that backed up the rights of slave owners as well as kept black slaves without human rights and the protection of the law. The motive behind this onslaught of black codes was that many white southerners had been taught that their white race put them above free blacks and slaves in the south and therefore deserved to be superior. Black codes were most notably prominent in Mississippi, South Carolina, followed by Alabam, Louisiana, Florida, Virgina, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Tennessee in late 1865 and early 1866. These laws were responsible for bringing detrimental to many former slaves’ way of living because if they failed to sign harsh labor contracts, black codes would opress them with imprisonment, punishment, and corporal punishment. For example, Police Regulations of St. Landry Parish, Louisiana had laws that stated that “Every negro is required to be in the regular service of some white person, or former owner, who shall be held responsible for the conduct of said negro...No negro shall sell, barter, or exchange any articles of merchandise or traffic within said parish without the special written permission of his employer” Each of these laws set up an economic and social system in which all free black people were stuck in a cycle of labor to white former slave owners as well as limiting all forms of black business in neighborhoods in southern states. Furthermore, these laws were enforced by the police officers of these laws and punishable by physical and economic punishment. Additionally, Mississippi Black codes restricted interacial communities and sowing the seeds for segregation with the law stating, “All freedmen, free negroes and mulattoes...found unlawfully assembling themselves together...and all white persons assembling themselves with freedmen, free negroes or mulattoes...on terms of equality, shall be deemed vagrants, and on conviction thereof shall be fined imprisonment at the discretion of the court.” This further ties in with the southern white man’s belief in white superiority and other racist ideals. These laws also addressed many ways in which people could enforce these black codes with laws stating that “Every civil officer shall, and every person may, arrest...any freedman, free negro, or mulatto who shall have quit the service of his or her employer before the expiration of his or her term of service without good cause.” which ties into how whites were given the right to take matters into their own hands and abuse black citizens and get them stuck in the shackles of the convict lease system, another form of southern retaliation that attempted to take advantage of the 13th amendment (which allowed for slavery in prison systems) and get free blacks to continue doing labor for whites. For example, many of the free black men who were punished for minor offenses were then given disproportionate prison sentences and leased over to work for white corporations. Once again setting up a system in which blacks are exploited for free labor by committing no other offense than being black, and considering the fact that the institution of slavery had fallen, white men had to find any way to acheive that same cycle of black labor and therefore used these black codes and the convict lease system to take advantage of blacks.

			<p>As a result of the Black Codes, African American men rounded up and accused of being vagrants, homeless and jobless wanderers.
An illustration of former black slaves being accompanied by several police officers after being arrested under a black code law after being "accused of being vagrants, homeless and jobless wanderers." edited by Lawrence W. Baker , Bridget Hall Grumet , Kelly King Howes , and Roger Matuz. The original photo is more biased towards democratic culture and the proslavery movement. The illustration depicts the black convicts as sluggish and lazy both in movement in demeanor in contrast with the posture of the white officers accompanying them. By representing this, the artist described the public perception of free blacks in southern society and how they weren't seen as productive and essential for the economic and social growth of the community. However, in this attempt to take away from the reputation of these blacks, the illustration still paints a picture that portrays the injustice of the black code laws, a legal system in which blacks were undermined by petty crimes and minor offenses into an attempt to get them convicted and abused for free labor under the 13th amendment’s clause allowing prisoners to be used for free labor in the south. This is because the black codes were the most brutal and violent at the time of this painting and the white south was most valiantly trying to maintain the free labor that they got from slavery after emancipation through black codes and the convict lease system.. This image is significant because not only do we get the white perspective of free blacks in society, but we can also infer the true story through the harsh enforcement of black code laws at the time.

			<h4>Chain gang in Richmond, Virginia</h4>
<p>An illustration by Colin A. Palmer of black people being forced by vagrancy laws into labor and forming chain gangs in a similar fashion to the southern hierarchy before emancipation. This image most directly depicts how free blacks were detained by enforcement officers and taken advantage of for their free labor in order to reestablish some sort of system similar to slavery before emancipation. Additionally, the artist’s depiction of white officers and employers in southern society depicts the harsh and brutal treatment of black workers and prisoners alike. The black workers are also in turn depicted as exhausted and exasperated from the long hours of labor and work with no pay and no substantial reimbursement. The black code laws, legal system in southern society that emphasized on taking advantage of black citizens by arresting them for small, petty crimes and convicting them for disproportionate sentences, which then allowed for white business owners to take advantage of free labor through the convict lease system. These events which occurred at the time of this painting allow for us to see that this image was a depiction of the labor of black prisoners and the hardships that came with being black in the south at the time.

<h3>Enforcement acts</h3>
<p>The Enforcement Acts came soon after the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, with the same intentions of attempting to increase safety and security for the Black community in America. The Enforcement acts were three separate bills passed by the United States Congress between 1870 and 1871. For further context, Ulysses S. Grant was president during this time period. The purpose behind the Enforcement Act was to protect African-Americans right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of all laws that apply to their community. They were also enacted to outlaw terrorist societies and allow the president to use the army against them. These laws continued the expansion of national authority during reconstruction. They were three individual laws or acts that were put in place with the intention of protecting the existing African American rights. The primary act prohibited individuals from assembling or disguising themselves with intentions to violate African Americans’ constitutional rights. The second Enforcement Act amended the first Enforcement Act by adding more severe punishments to the revisions. This act was best enforced by the United States Government. Congress passed the third and final measure, more famously known as the Ku Klux Klan Act. This Act outlawed terrorist conspiracies by all racist vigilantes including but not limited to the Ku Klux Klan. The enforcement acts were mainly directed towards the south, where the protection of African Americans was most necessary since there were many hate crimes occurring. The enforcement acts ensured that there would be repercussions and legal consequences if you try to challenge or disregard the rights that the black community recently acquired.

		<h4>A Few Members of the Ku Klux Klan(KKK)</h4>
		<p>The image above is of a few Ku Klux Klan(KKK) members, an infamous terrorist organization that was created directly after the civil war ended with the primary goal of disrupting peace within the black community. After the war was over, and slaves were officially free, it was a natural reaction from the south to do everything in their power to “keep the black community in their place” and continue to terrorize them. The KKK lynched thousands of innocent blacks over the years, and this immediate rise in hate crimes is what led to the implementation of the enforcement acts as well as the fourteenth amendment. One of the main reasons the KKK was able to get away with thousands of acts of hatred is the institutions in the south didn’t care about their black citizens, and this violence was almost promoted. Terrorism like this, as you can imagine made it hard for the black community to feel free, and the oppression continued far after the end of slavery. Even though, these horrific acts of violence and hatred continued, the enforcement acts were at least a step forward in protecting America’s black community.
